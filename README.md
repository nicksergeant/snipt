# Snipt

This is the codebase for the website, [Snipt.net](https://snipt.net/).

It's a relatively well-kept Django app, so you shouldn't have too many problems
getting a local copy running.

# Running the Django app

1. Clone the repo.
2. Setup a virtualenv.
3. `pip install -r requirements`
4. Copy local_settings-template.py to local_settings.py and edit the settings.
5. Run it!
